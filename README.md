# Rent or Buy?



This interactive notebook will help you decide whether to rent or buy a house. 

Click the button at the very bottom to launch the interactive simulation, and wait for it to load (it can take around a minute to load. Once it has loaded, go to the "Cells" menu and click "Run Cells"). The simulation will now run, and you can move the sliders to see what happens.
